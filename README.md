# Server Scripts
A collection of scripts that I use frequently on my home server.

## Script Categories:
[LXC Helpers](https://github.com/AncientAbysswalker/Server-Scripts/LXC_Helpers) - Bash scripts that I use to simplify working with [LXC Containers](https://linuxcontainers.org)

[DNS Sync](https://github.com/AncientAbysswalker/Server-Scripts/DNS_Sync) - Python Script that I run as a CRON job, to update DNS records when my ISP changes my external IP address
